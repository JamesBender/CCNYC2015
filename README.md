Sides and demos from CC NYC 2015

## BDD
To run the demo for this you'll first need to install the SpecFlow VS extension for your version of Visual Studio. You can get this at (SpecFlow.org)

If you are creating your own demo app you'll need to install the Spec Flow package and a test running from NuGet. If you use the integated Spec Flow and nUnit package remember that you need to download the Spec Flow only package afterward to upgrade the 1.9.0 version of the library. You'll get some friendly compiler errors to remind you if you forget. ;)
